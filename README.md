# SHSID Interactive Course Catalog

An interactive course selection tool for SHSID students, built by SHSID students at the Indexademics and Data Science teams, designed to enable students to build their 4-year plan.

### Intuition
Navigating the SHSID course catalog can be complex, with a web of prerequisites, tracks (AP, IB, A-Level), and course dependencies. We built this tool to transform the static hard-cover catalog into a dynamic, visual map that gives more accessibility to students across campus. 

We also noticed that students often don't realize which courses are for who. Even though the course catalog offers introductions, sometimes a direct rating and comment from students are what's needed to really tell courses apart. 

- **Backend, designs, UI (by [Will Chen](https://github.com/WillUHD))**: uses a graph theory optimized / topological sorting approach for checking course configuration rules, to make sure selection roadmaps remain accurate. Remote profile fetched [here](https://github.com/WillUHD/CourseResources).
- **Frontend concepts, prototypes, maintaining (by [Ziqian Huang](https://github.com/Ziqian-Huang0607))**: a modern looking wrapper that renders the state faithfully according to the backend, ensuring the UI is a perfect reflection of the underlying logic.

### Use the interactive features
- Start by selecting any course and build your 4-year roadmap from there! 
- You can plan move-ups, get real course rule checking, and more to build the comprehensive profile that suits you best.
- The courses relate cross-grade, cross-subject, and cross-level, which checks all configurations along with you
- Uses a modern, clean, and minimal interface with familiar human design principles that visually update in real-time based on backend logic
- Click on any info panel to open a detailed view with crowdsourced student notes/ratings, and enter the search bar for the exact course you like. 
  
### Public API (for third-party developers)

This repo ships a free, open, CORS-enabled JSON API (Vercel serverless functions in [`api/`](./api)) that exposes the same catalog and prerequisite solver the website uses. If you're building a website, server, or script on top of our data, start here:

- `GET /api/courses` — flat JSON list of all courses (filter by `grade`, `track`, `department`, `q`, `available`)
- `GET /api/courses/:id` — one course + availability
- `GET /api/catalog` / `GET /api/meta` — full nested catalog / metadata
- `GET /api/grades` · `GET /api/tracks` · `GET /api/departments` · `GET /api/status`
- `POST /api/validate` — validate a course plan with the real solver
- `POST /api/availability` — per-course availability for any plan
- `GET /api/ratings` · `GET /api/ratings/:id` — crowd rating tallies
- `POST /api/ratings` — cast a student rating (1–10); one vote per voter per course
